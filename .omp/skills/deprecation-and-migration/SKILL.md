# Deprecation & Migration

Deprecation is a communication protocol. Migration is the execution plan. Both must be explicit, gradual, and reversible until the cutover point.

**Core principle:** Never remove without warning. Never warn without a replacement. Never migrate without a rollback plan.

## When to Use

- Deprecating an API endpoint, function, or module
- Migrating between major library/framework versions
- Removing legacy code paths or feature flags
- Planning breaking changes across multiple consumers

## When NOT to Use

- Internal refactors that don't affect any public API or consumer
- Bug fixes that change behavior (that's a fix, not a migration)
- Adding new features alongside existing ones (no deprecation needed)

## Deprecation Process

```
1. ANNOUNCE  — Mark as deprecated with notice + replacement + timeline
2. PROVIDE   — Ship the replacement alongside the deprecated code
3. MIGRATE   — Help consumers move (codemods, guides, examples)
4. MONITOR   — Track usage of deprecated paths
5. REMOVE    — Remove only after usage drops to zero (or deadline passes)
```

## Deprecation Notices

### In Code

```typescript
/**
 * @deprecated Use `createUser()` instead. Will be removed in v3.0.
 * Migration guide: https://docs.example.com/migrate-v3
 */
export function addUser(name: string): User {
  console.warn(
    "addUser() is deprecated. Use createUser() instead. See: https://docs.example.com/migrate-v3",
  );
  return createUser({ name });
}
```

### Checklist

- [ ] `@deprecated` JSDoc tag with replacement name
- [ ] Runtime warning on first call (not every call — use a flag)
- [ ] Migration guide URL in the deprecation message
- [ ] Removal version/date specified
- [ ] TypeScript: mark with `@deprecated` for IDE strikethrough

## Migration Guide Template

```markdown
# Migration: v2 → v3

## Breaking Changes

| Change | Before | After | Effort |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| `addUser` → `createUser` | `addUser(name)` | `createUser({ name })` | S |
| Config format | `config.key` | `config.settings.key` | M |

## Step-by-Step

1. Update dependency: `npm install pkg@3.0.0`
2. Run codemod: `npx pkg-migrate v2-to-v3`
3. Manual fixes: [list of manual changes]
4. Verify: `npm test && npm run typecheck`

## Rollback

If issues arise: `npm install pkg@2.x.x` — v2 APIs still work until v4.

## Timeline

- v2.5.0: Deprecation warnings added
- v3.0.0: New API shipped, old API still works with warnings
- v3.5.0: Old API removed (6 months after v3.0.0)
```

## Codemod Patterns

### When to Write a Codemod

| Consumers | Change Complexity | Write Codemod? |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| 1-5 call sites | Simple rename | No — manual is faster |
| 5-20 call sites | Simple rename | Maybe — saves time and consistency |
| 20+ call sites | Any change | Yes — manual migration is error-prone |
| Any count | Complex restructure | Yes — reduce human error |

## Staged Rollout

```
Phase 1: Ship new API alongside old (backward compatible)
  └── Duration: 1-2 release cycles
  └── Verify: New API works, old API still works

Phase 2: Add deprecation warnings to old API
  └── Duration: 2-4 release cycles
  └── Monitor: Track warning frequency, identify stragglers

Phase 3: Remove old API
  └── Only when: Usage is zero OR deadline passed
  └── Verify: No references remain in codebase
  └── Rollback: Revert removal if unexpected breakage
```

## Feature Flag Cleanup

Feature flags are a form of deprecation — they accumulate if not cleaned up.

```
1. Deploy feature behind flag (OFF)
2. Enable for team → canary → percentage → 100%
3. Once stable at 100%: REMOVE the flag
4. Delete: flag definition, branching code, old code path
5. Verify: tests pass without the flag
```

**Flag lifecycle max:** 30 days at 100% before cleanup is mandatory.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Rebuttal |
|--------|----------|
| "Nobody uses the old API" | Prove it with usage data. Assumption ≠ evidence. |
| "It's an internal API, just change it" | Internal consumers break too. Deprecate or coordinate. |
| "Deprecation warnings are noisy" | That's the point — they surface migration debt before it's an emergency. |
| "The codemod is too much work" | One codemod saves N manual migrations. Calculate the actual ROI. |
| "Just bump the major version" | A version bump without a migration path is abandonment, not deprecation. |

## Red Flags — STOP

- Breaking change shipped without deprecation period
- Deprecated code removed before usage reaches zero
- No migration guide or codemod for complex changes
- Feature flags older than 90 days without cleanup plan
- Runtime deprecation warnings suppressed instead of addressed

## Verification

- [ ] Deprecated APIs have `@deprecated` tags with replacement
- [ ] Runtime warnings fire on deprecated API usage
- [ ] Migration guide exists with step-by-step + rollback
- [ ] Usage of deprecated paths is tracked/monitored
- [ ] Feature flags have documented cleanup dates
- [ ] Codemod written for changes affecting 20+ call sites

## Anti-Patterns

| Anti-Pattern | Instead |
|-------------|---------|
| Deleting APIs without a deprecation period | Announce deprecation → warn in code → remove next major version |
| Breaking changes without migration guide | Provide before/after examples and automated migration |
| Deprecating without a timeline | State when removal will happen |
| Migration scripts that can't be rolled back | Make migrations reversible or provide rollback steps |
| Skipping version bump on breaking changes | Major = breaking; minor = additive; patch = fix |
| Deprecating something with no replacement | Have the replacement ready before deprecating |
